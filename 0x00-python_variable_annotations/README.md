In this project, I explored the world of Python variable annotations. Through hands-on tasks, I've learned how to use type annotations to improve code readability and reduce errors⚠️. This journey has enhanced my understanding of Python's capabilities and best practices. 

## Tasks📝
| Task | Files Used | Description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 0. Basic annotations - add | [0-add.py](./0-add.py) | Implement a function with annotations. |
| 1. Basic annotations - concat | [1-concat.py](./1-concat.py) | Concatenate two strings with annotations. |
| 2. Basic annotations - floor | [2-floor.py](./2-floor.py) | Use annotations to return the floor of a float. |
| 3. Basic annotations - to string | [3-to_string.py](./3-to_string.py) | Annotate a function to convert to string. |
| 4. Define variables | [4-define_variables.py](./4-define_variables.py) | Define and annotate variables. |

## Conclusion 🎉
Completing these tasks has been an enlightening experience. I've gained practical skills that will be invaluable in my future Python projects. The clarity that variable annotations bring to the code is truly a game-changer. I'm excited to apply these new insights to create more robust and maintainable code. 🌟
